# Express-server-tennis

An example of two express servers (on ports 3000 and 4000) that plays tennis. Incredible but true.

## How on earth?

When both servers are running, a `GET` request to port 3000 will trigger the first stroke (Volley, backhand, forehand or maybe a smash). The responding server will act upon this `POST` request and strike back, and so forth...


## Wanna help and develop?

Please do. There may be some open issues, and if not, please add one if you want to.
